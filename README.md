# Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences

A drop-in starter-kit for Emacs 24, derived from [Phil Hagelberg's](https://github.com/technomancy) and [Eric Schulte's](https://github.com/eschulte/) originals, but now somewhat different from those. Designed for social scientists researching and writing in plain text using some combination of LaTeX, R, ESS, Git, Markdown, and Org-Mode.

For installation instructions, see the [Social Science Starter Kit page](http://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit.html).

# Installation

I found installation of emacs using homebrew to be the easiest approach on Mac OS X.

	brew install emacs --cocoa
	brew link emacs

# Git

I'm working off of orgv8
